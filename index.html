              thoughts and concerns regarding the upcoming fall semester.</p>

                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left;"> <strong>Interview #1</strong><br>
                  The interviewee was primarily concerned with the potential loss of connection and not being able to
                  experience a “typical first semester”. Her main obstacles and frustrations were not being able to make
                  friends and acquaintances, not being able to live on campus, and not being able to join organizations
                  or be involved on campus.</p>

                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left;"> <strong>Interview #2</strong><br>
                  The interviewee wants the “normal college experience” and admits that living at home would not be
                  ideal. In the event that social interactions are limited to virtual meetings, she is worried that it 
                  will be more difficult to meet and befriend her classmates. She says online interactions 
                  can be “awkward” for people like her who aren’t accustomed to initiating conversations with
                  strangers. She also desires to get involved in the community at Wellesley.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left;"> <strong>Interview #3</strong><br>
                  The interviewee feels that the social aspect of would not be “complete”, especially as she thinks it
                  may not be as connected as other orientations she has heard of in the past. She is also concerned
                  with not having many connections until class starts in person, which could be months away. An ideal
                  situation for her would be an online experience as close to the normal experience as possible, with
                  students being as active as they probably would be in person. She hopes to join organizations related 
                  to politics, art, or casual
                  sport. </p>

            Anna, 18, is an incoming freshman at Wellesley College. She was heavily involved in her high school’s
            political club and debate team, and is hoping to continue similar activities on campus as well as explore
            new organizations. As an extroverted and outgoing person, she was initially excited about the possibility
            of making many new friends on campus. However, the potential remote semester causes her to worry about
            having less opportunities to connect when she reaches campus, or even not having opportunities at all due
            to remote instruction and time zone differences. Regardless of location status, she wants to have the ability
            to connect with other incoming freshmen and begin forming friendships. She especially wants to use the website
            as a platform for easy connection to other students with similar interests within her school, rather than
            seeking out individuals on the Facebook page.

          <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left;"> <strong>Scenario 2:</strong><br>
            Brittany is a highly creative and reserved incoming student. Throughout high school she was involved in
            many artistic and creative endeavors, including community outreach and freelancing. She looks forward to
            starting at Wellesley in the fall and plans on majoring in English or Art. Contributing to her community
            is extremely important to Brittany. She seeks to find purpose by using her creative skills to help those
            around her. She also seeks community through various extracurriculars and shared interests. Brittany is
            ready to get involved at Wellesley, but is overwhelmed by the sheer number of organizations. She knows that
            she should commit to only a few orgs so her passion is not divided. She is open to exploring several orgs
            before deciding which ones to commit her four undergraduate years to.

          <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left;"> <strong>Scenario 3:</strong><br>
            Brittany is an incoming first year at Wellesley College. She is  not the most active on social media, and
            typically communicates with friends via text. As an introvert, she finds it difficult to open up to
            strangers, making it harder to find new friends. She has some anxiety about starting in the fall, and the
            possibility of a remote fall semester only worsens this stress since she won’t be able to connect with
            people who could support her. She seeks to connect with a big, Wellesley tradition in which underclassmen
            are paired with upperclassmen who offer support and mentorship. She hopes that finding a big will ease her
            transition since she will be able to connect with someone and ask questions. She hopes to find a big who
            shares her interest and understands her personality and communication style.  </p>

            also provides the user with easy navigation to all the app's features. The user can conveniently access the
            dashboard by pressing the home button in the top right corner. </p>

            three tabs clearly correspond to the three main functions of the app: connect with classmates, find a Big, and
            explore the Orgs. The design eliminates any unnecessary frills with a minimalist interface.

          <h5><b>Design Rationale:</b></h5><br>
          <p style="text-align:left">After considering the feedback, we decided to combine elements from both interfaces to
          create a new design that incorporated the onboarding slides and navigation bar from Design 2 with the dashboard
          from Design 1. We added an in-app messaging feature for communication between students.We also added an
          additional side menu that wasn’t a part of either initial design interfaces for added efficiency and
            functionality as well as redundancy to allow users to access the same page through several different avenues.</p>

        <p style="text-align:left">Design Rationale:<br>
        <ul style="text-align:left"><li><b>Interface:</b> Minimal yet engaging for easy use by the members of the incoming class. Incorporates
        elements from existing social media for learnability, such as a dashboard, a simple navigation bar, and a
        scrollable page of profiles.</li>
        <li><b>Color scheme:</b> Monochromatic color scheme, with red - the 2024 class color - as the primary color. The
            scheme was chosen to be minimal and aesthetically cohesive while establishing familiarity with the
            incoming class.</li>
        <li><b>Graphic Design:</b> Simple and minimalistic icons and navigation, to avoid visual clutter. Subtle boxes in
            muted colors group like items together, like classmates.</li>
        <li><b>Typography:</b> SF Pro, the system font for iOS, provides external consistency and legibility.</li></p>

        <h3><b>Heuristic Evaluation Takeaways</b></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p style="text-align:left">Overall, our evaluators liked the simple and minimalistic interface. They also liked the ease of navigation present in the app, and the aesthetically pleasing and fitting design. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">One common critique is that the needs to be distinct separations between the saved contacts and the entire class of 2024. The "Classmates" and "Saved Contacts" are both accessed by heart icons, which caused confusion for the evaluators. We would fix this by haing separate locations for saved contacts and the general classmate browsing feature. The placement of the inbox button on the messaging page also caused confusion, which we will address by altering in a future iteration.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Another takeaway from the evaluations is that users need a way to edit the basic information they place in their questionnaire, due to events such as a mustake or change of pronouns. We will fix this by allowing users to alter their profiles by easily changing their inputs.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Some other elements mentioned in the heuristic evaluations: ensuring the vanigation bar is consistent acorss all pages; making the process of sending a message to a user more efficient; allowing the user to stay on the messaging page after sending a message; and adding help documentation to the app. </p>

          <h4><b>Takeaways and Future Iterations</b></h4>
          <p style="text-align:left">We first want to focus on fixing certain features mentioned in the heuristic design evaluation to make the user experience more seamless. These include:</p>
          <div><ul style="text-align:left">
            <li>Accounting for every single action the user could take on the app and creating a more comprehensive prototype that is fully clickable and seamless.</li>
            <li>Changing some icons to eliminate confusion over the two separate heart icons (classmates and saved contacts)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align:left">We then want to enhance the application by adding more engaging features, such as:</p>
          <div><ul style="text-align:left">
            <li>Allowing organizations to create an account and update/add information about their orgs. Students would also be able to message organizations in app rather than the current function which is external email. </li>
